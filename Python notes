WHY PYTHON ?
``````````
-simple syntax and short -compared to other languages like - java
-hackers prefer python for its ease of use
-library support-lots of inbuilt functions-powerful web application development
-very productive programming - time required to code is less.
-object oriented
-community support - for all developer/hacker/newbie/programmer
-fastest growing language - in terms of 
    - number of users & companies
    - number of libraries
    - areas of implementation (machine learning, gui,scientific calculations, web & software development)
-General purpose language, simple & easy to learn ( Data scientists & Data researchers wanted a simple language to learn faster by spending less time on coding)
-Interpreted language ( needs an interpreter to run code) object oreinted & highlevel language
-was invented way before java in 1989
-used by companies like google,nasa,dropbox, yahoo, youtube, reddit (completely built on python) etc

PYTHON INSTALLATION:
```````````````````
-Download python installation package from official website & install(use google for instructions - especially while installing on linux machine.)
-python versions - 1.x,2.x,3.x - currently 3.x is in trend with lots of new features though 2.x is still running in market
-setup the environment for running python (from command prompt/IDE)
-Need an interpreter since its an interpreted language
-Need an IDE - Integrated Development Environment - to build an application we need to build a project and code-debugging facility 
    -Pycharm
    -IDLE
    -Anaconda

WHY DO WE CODE ?
``````````````
-To talk to computer and get the work done.
-Computer cant understand human speaking english. It can understand only binary language whereas Human cant understand binary language but english.
-Coding is a language which both human & computer can understand.
-So when we write a code instructing computer to perform certain task, it is converted into binary language instruction and the work is completed by computer.
